    Admittedly, this is long. But you need it. Well, if you don't want music,
    then get rid of the first two lines. But Nyan Cat will annihilate you for
    doing so.
    Few things to note:
    1) Remove any existing blocks from the block arrays AND the screen div object.
    you can't just do topBlocks = []; etc. As the blocks will still be displayed
    on the screen. I personally used a while loop because if you use a for loop you have
    to be careful of the usual i<topBlocks.length as you ARE DELETING FROM THE ARRAY,
    which affects the condition.
    2) Reset Nyan Cat's speed, position, current score.
    3) Start the interval and store the fact it is running as a boolean.

    And Viola! Nyan Cat starts on his journey through DOUBLE RAINBOWS ALL THE WAY!!!
